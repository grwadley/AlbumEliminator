# Album Eliminator

Album Eliminator is a small game that takes all of a user's saved Spotify albums, and has them select a winner in head to head matchups until the eventual winner is crowned, and a top 10 list is shown.

This application runs on node.js, makes use of Spotify's API, and is currently running here on Heroku: https://album-eliminator.herokuapp.com/
